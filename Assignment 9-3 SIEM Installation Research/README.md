# SIEM Installation Research
In the next Milestone Project (Milestone 8 - Putting the SEC in DevOps), there will be the following goals:

*   *   Use Ansible to install the SIEM of your choice on the BLUE1-LAN, examples might include: 

        *   Splunk
        *   Graylog
        *   Wazuh
        *   ELK Stack
        *   Velociraptor
        *   FleetDM

*   *   Use Ansible to install a SIEM agent of your choice on a BLUE-LAN based system (not the SIEM).  Your goal is to install the server and agent and get the events flowing without manual intervention.

To help prepare for that Milestone, please complete the following this week:

1.  Research and identify which SIEM you will install

2.  Research and find installation documentation for that SIEM, please consider:

    *   Which OS is it for (you will need to deploy server(s) to run it - so anything you have a base VM for might be a good choice)?
    *   Is the documentation current? (look for a reputable source that is recent)
    *   Can you find some consistency among the documentation from multiple sources?
    *   Make sure to have both server and agent install documentation

**Deliverables: (in document or linked from tech journal)**

*   **List what SIEM you will use, what server OS and which agent on the BLUE network you will use**
*   **List/link the install guide(s) that you will use**
*   **Outline the server and agent install steps as it will be valuable for building your Ansible playbooks**
